# TAPSILOG-Sub_LogInorOut
This the First GUI project for one of my course. This Was made with my group: This software is made for the subdivision Homeowner and visitor whenever they Enter or exit the Subdivision using a QR code that is also generated with the software.

# REGISTER ADMIN:
Admins are the one who controls the whole system (can be the Security guards in the Gate of Subdivisions), He can register a new homeowner or a visitor and he can also have the control to send QR by the registered email of the Visitor or Homeowner>

Admin should Have:
- Username
- Password
- Email
- Security Code Access (send to the Admins' email if registered)

# DEVELOPER CODE
- W T C 9 1 1 6 9 4 2 0 -

This code will be use to see all the admin for the Higher Ups.
